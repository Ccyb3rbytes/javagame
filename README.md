COURSE OBJECTIVES:
Demonstrate basic formal problem-solving techniques for programming.
Describe and apply variables, basic and composite data types, and collections.  
Develop basic and common algorithms using the elements of structured programming.
Create simple functions that accept parameters and return results.
Demonstrate effective troubleshooting, testing, and debugging, of programs. 
Objectives

Understand the role of JavaScript Functions
Write Functions
Comment Functions
Comment code to show your understanding of it.
Understand Inline JavaScript
Understand External JavaScript
Requirements

Create a new webpage called game.html
Add a button to the game.html program to play a game.
You can choose a game of your own (NOT guess a number) or use the rules below to implement at least one random #, some math, conditionals (if/else if/else), and have all the output go the web page from the .js through the use of “.innerhtml “in the javascript.
In a separate code.js page, write a function to implement the game (the function called when the button is clicked)
Comment the function to describe what it does.
Create another function that takes a parameter and uses this input value and outputs results.
Comment almost every line of HTML and JavaScript code demonstrating you know what it does.
Link the .js file to the main HTML file.
Test the program and insure it works properly.
Add a great User Experience, Turn this into Quarks Casino or your choice – make it your own!
Craps Rules

Generate 2 random #s between 1 and 6/output

Calculate the sum/output

If sum = 7 or sum = 11, output CRAPS – you lose!

Else if die1 = die2 and die1 % 2 = 0

Note – die1 %2 = 0 means die1 is even and Else if die1 = die2 and die1 % 2 = 0 means the die are equal (doubles) and even (2,4,6).

            Output You won!

Else

            Output     You pushed!
